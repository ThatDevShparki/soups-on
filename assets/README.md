### Tiles

- Map tiles are **32px x 32 px**
    - Map decor items may be smaller than 32x32 but would be contained within a single 32x32 tile
    - Map tiles may have transparency, but no more than 3px will be cut out on any either side
        - Bounding boxes will still be 32x32
        - This doesn't apply to decor items
- Typical ingredient stages maps are **16 tiles x 48 tiles**
    - Special stages do not follow this
